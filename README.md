Implementing basic data structures, multiple source files and using git

All the function definitions required to do the operations on the data structures are present in the function.c file.

There are different files for the main functions. All of them implement the data structures using the definitions present in function.c.

There are 3 header files as of now (1135 hours IST, 31 Mar, 2017) - one for function declarations, one for structure definitions and another for the required header files to be included in each main file.

All compilations require the user to compile function.c file and another main_ file as required.
